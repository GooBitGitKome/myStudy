class PrePostDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i); // "4" 
        ++i;
        System.out.println(i); // "5" 
        System.out.println(++i); // "6" 
        System.out.println(i++); // "6" 
        System.out.println(i); // "7"
    } 
}

There is difference between i++ and ++i: 
First, i++ is meant that "i++" is implemented, after any other statement on the same line. have been implemented.
Then, ++i means that when entering the line where "++i" is in, first the increment have happend. Then the whole line is implemented.
