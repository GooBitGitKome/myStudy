Even after the inserting of the code of "p = new Point(0, 0);" to movePoint(Point p), the out put will be "(x, y) = (100, 120)" 
Because that first the parameter p know the domain of the variables's point, 
the parameter p is changed into the new domain of class Point, 
besides that, the variables point and the parameter p are not involved each other after the change.
