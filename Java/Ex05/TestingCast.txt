⚫ Which of the operations in 1.- 6. above are explicit casts?

⚫ Why can an object reference of type Point refer to an object of type MovingPoint? 
Point class is superclass of MovingPoint class
⚫ In operation 3., can we assign o2 to o3 without casting and why?
It cannot, because compiler can not understand whether o2 as Point class has children or subclasses or not.
So we need explicitly to cast super class to sub class.
